# Email Etiquette

Taking the email etiquette into account, write the following emails:

1. Write an email to your lecturer (Mairead Meagher) at mairead.meagher@setu.ie informing her that you cannot attend class on December 25th. 

2. Write an email to a classmate, informing her that you cannot attend class on January 1st 2026. CC your lecturer. Attach a file to the email - perhaps a picture of your country/county flag.

3. Write an email to three (or more) classmates informing them that there will be a class test on December 1st. CC your lecturer. 

4. When you receive emails experiment with reply, reply all, forward and downloading file attachments.
