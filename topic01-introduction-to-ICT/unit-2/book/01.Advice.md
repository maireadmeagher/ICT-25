# Lab advice

- Your labs are not a race to be the first student finished.

- It is very important that you:
    - take your time.
    - read the instructions carefully.
    - ask your lecturer to explain concepts that you don't understand; that is what we are here for!


- If you have any questions, please ask your lecturer.
