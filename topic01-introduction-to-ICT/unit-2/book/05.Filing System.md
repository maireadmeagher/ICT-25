## Classes and Objects

When we program in Java, we often want to model things from the real world. To do this, we use classes and objects.

- A **class** is like a blueprint or a set of instructions. 
        - It describes what a thing is and what it can do.

- An **object** is an actual thing built from the class. 
        - You can create many objects from the same class, just like you can build many houses from one blueprint.

**Example:**

- Circle is a class (a blueprint for circles).
- myCircle is an object (a specific circle you can see and use).



**We’ll use a project called Figures in BlueJ.**

The project already has some classes: Circle, Square, and Triangle.

We’ll create objects from these classes.

Then, by calling methods (like makeVisible(), moveRight(), or changeColor("red")), we can change how the objects look or behave.

By combining different objects, you’ll build your own picture out of shapes.
