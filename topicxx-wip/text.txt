Measuring the Rate of Reaction Between Hydrochloric Acid and Magnesium

Purpose
To investigate how the concentration of hydrochloric acid affects the rate of its reaction with magnesium ribbon.

Apparatus
Conical flask
Measuring cylinder
Stopwatch
Ruler
Magnesium ribbon
Hydrochloric acid solutions (0.5 M, 1.0 M, 1.5 M, 2.0 M)

Method
1. Measure 25 mL of hydrochloric acid into the conical flask.
2. Add a pre-cut 5 cm length of magnesium ribbon.
3. Start the stopwatch immediately.
4. Record the time taken for the magnesium to completely dissolve.
5. Repeat for each concentration of acid.

Results Table
Concentration (M)   Time (s)   Rate (1/time)
0.5                68         0.015
1.0                45         0.022
1.5                28         0.036
2.0                20         0.050

Equation
Mg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) â†’ MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)

Discussion
As the concentration of hydrochloric acid increases, the reaction time decreases.
This is because higher concentration means more frequent collisions between acid particles and magnesium atoms.

Conclusion
The rate of reaction increases with acid concentration.
